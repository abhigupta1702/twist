# Installing Twist

> **NOTE**: The easiest way to start using Twist is to use one of our pre-configured [starter projects](./starter-projects.md). These are pre-configured with Webpack, Babel, and various plugins to make Twist development easy.

Twist is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@twist/core). You can add it to your project as follows:

```bash
npm install --save @twist/core
```
