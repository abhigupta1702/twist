# Observables

Twist is built around the concepts of **observables** and **reactivity**. To accomplish this, Twist relies upon you to _instrument_ your data model and stores by indicating which of your model's fields should be observed. You can then build your app to respond to changes on those fields using **watches** or other components that are designed to track references for you automatically.

An observable is a class field that has been instrumented with the [`@Observable`](../reference/decorators/Observable.md) decorator. This decorator will automatically create a getter and a setter to track references and changes to the field.

## Bindings

An observable tracks references, or **bindings**, to observables whenever those fields are accessed. By keeping track of those accesses, it's possible to build a dependency tree during runtime. Then, should any dependency be invalidated, the other bindings can also be invalidated and then re-evaluated.

## Reactivity

Whenever a field is modified, the associated bindings are automatically invalidated and re-evaluated. When this occurs, notifications are generated which indicate that a change has occurred. You can subscribe to these notifications by using the `watch` method on any class that inherits from [`SignalDispatcher`](../reference/core/SignalDispatcher.md).

## Non-primitive fields

The `@Observable` decorator only works with primitive fields â€“ that is, fields that are of a primitive type (like a number or string). In order to observe changes within an `Array`, `Set`, or `Map`, one must create an observable instance. Twist provides an observable wrapper for each case: [`ObservableArray`](../core/ObservableArray.md), [`ObservableSet`](../core/ObservableSet.md), and [`ObservableMap`](.../core/ObservableMap.md). In each case, the methods you would expect are present, although `ObservableArray`s are not indexed using brackets as are `Array`s. Instead you can use `at` and `setAt`. For example:

`Array` instance   | `ObservableArray` instance
-------------------|---------------------------
`const x = a[1];`  | `const x = a.at(1);`
`a[2] = x;`        | `a.setAt(2, x);`
