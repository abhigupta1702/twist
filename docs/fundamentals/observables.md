# Observables

Twist is built around the concepts of **observables** and **reactivity**. To accomplish this, Twist relies upon you to _instrument_ your data model and stores by indicating which of your model's fields should be observed. You can then build your app to respond to changes on those fields using **watches** or other components that are designed to track references for you automatically.
