# Twist

Twist is a state-management library for JavaScript applications. It's influenced by [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx), which are two of the popular state-management libraries for React.

See the [API documentation](docs/index.md).

## Setup

## Example

This repo contains an example of using twist in a framework-agnostic way. To get setup, run:

    npm install
    npm run watch

To use twist in your application, you need to include the following dependencies in your package.json:

* `@twist/core`

You'll also need the decorators Babel plugin, or you can use `@twist/webpack-plugin` to configure this for you.
